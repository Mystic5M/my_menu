# my_menu
my_menu is a custom admin script for FIVEM ONLY made by me.

It is being worked on frequently, have a suggestion? DM @melmothegreat62 on discord. Will get to you as soon as possible.

Any bugs also DM me.

Please do not modify anything unless you know what your doing...

To give someone access to this menu, give them admin through TXADMIN.

If you acidentally ban someone, it saves in the bans.json file. REMOVE THE WHOLE LINE AND REPLACE IT WITH EXACTLY "[]" OTHERWISE IT WONT WORK.

To start the resource, put the [admin] file inside your server's resources folder and in your server.cfg file put ensure [admin] and it should work. If not DM me for support.

But for now, ENJOY.
